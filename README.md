## 🔥 BRK243: Claw and Agent Harness in Microsoft Foundry

### Session Description

Go deep on multi-agent systems built on Microsoft Foundry, featuring Claw agent patterns and the hosted agents architecture. Explore long-running agents with triggers, state management, and file access—all natively supported on Foundry. See how coding agents built with GitHub Copilot SDK and Claude Agent SDK integrate into multi-agent workflows using Microsoft Agent Framework. Learn how to coordinate, host, and operate these systems with observability and continuous evals.

### 🏠 Getting started in your own environment

If you're following these steps at your own pace:
- Clone this repository
- Set up your development environment
- Configure Azure AI environment variables (see "Run the Agent Harness samples" below)

### 🧪 Run the Agent Harness samples

This repository includes runnable .NET samples under `src/Agent-Harness`.

1. Install prerequisites:
     - .NET 10 SDK
     - Azure CLI (`az login`)
2. Set environment variables:

```powershell
$env:AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT = "https://<your-project>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-name>"
$env:AZURE_AI_MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME = "gpt-5.4"
```

3. Build all sample projects from the repo root:

```powershell
$projects = @(
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\ConsoleReactiveFramework\\ConsoleReactiveFramework.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\ConsoleReactiveComponents\\ConsoleReactiveComponents.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Shared_Console\\Harness_Shared_Console.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Shared_Console_OpenAI\\Harness_Shared_Console_OpenAI.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Step01_Research\\Harness_Step01_Research.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Step02_Research_WithBackgroundAgents\\Harness_Step02_Research_WithBackgroundAgents.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Step03_DataProcessing\\Harness_Step03_DataProcessing.csproj",
    ".\\src\\Agent-Harness\\Harness_Step04_CodeExecution\\Harness_Step04_CodeExecution.csproj"
)

foreach ($p in $projects) {
    dotnet build $p -nologo
}
```

4. Run individual steps:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\Agent-Harness\Harness_Step01_Research\Harness_Step01_Research.csproj
dotnet run --project .\src\Agent-Harness\Harness_Step02_Research_WithBackgroundAgents\Harness_Step02_Research_WithBackgroundAgents.csproj
dotnet run --project .\src\Agent-Harness\Harness_Step03_DataProcessing\Harness_Step03_DataProcessing.csproj
dotnet run --project .\src\Agent-Harness\Harness_Step04_CodeExecution\Harness_Step04_CodeExecution.csproj
```

For per-sample details and prompts to try, see `src/Agent-Harness/README.md`.
